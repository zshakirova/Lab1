# Zhamilya Shakirova
## Welcome to my web page!
### In this webpage I'll tell about myself as a programmer and as a person
I was born and raised in **Kazakhstan** - country in Central Asia.
I'm trilingual, so I know *Russian*, *Kazakh*, and *English*
What internet says about Kazakhstan?
> Kazakhstan is the world's ninth-largest country by land area and the largest landlocked country.
> This is the [link](https://aboutkazakhstan.com/blog/entertainment/12-interesting-facts-about-kazakhstan/) to more facts! 
I'm also a programmer. I have an experience in Python, Java, C++.
